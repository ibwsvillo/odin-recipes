    <h3>Blinchiki are small, thin Russian pancakes often filled with savory or sweet fillings and then cooked or baked. They are a variation of blini or crepes, and the name "blinchiki" is a diminutive form, often used when referring to the filled versions. </h3>
    <p>In the West, blini traditionally refers to small savory pancakes made with leavened batter. In modern Russian, the term most often refers to pan-sized leavened thin pancakes, although smaller leavened pancakes are also called blini. Smaller and thicker pancakes (with several of them baked on one larger pan) are called oladyi.</p>
    <p>Blintzes, called blinchiki (little blinis) in Russian are an offshoot of blini or crêpes. They are basically rolls based on thin pancakes usually made of wheat flour, folded to form a casing for various kinds of filing, typically cheese, fruit, or (in Russian cuisine) pre-fried minced meat, and then sautéed or baked</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups (250 grams) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon (12 grams) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2-3 cups (470-710 milliliters) milk</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons (30 milliliters) vegetable oil plus more or butter for the pan</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, and salt.</li>
        <li>Slowly whisk in the milk until combined and no lumps remain. Add 2 cups (470 milliliters) milk for slightly thicker and easier to handle pancakes or up to 3 cups (710 milliliters) milk for thinner, more delicate pancakes.</li>
        <li>Whisk in the eggs, followed by the vegetable oil. If too thick, slowly add a little more milk. If too thin, slowly add a little more flour.</li>
        <li>Cover the bowl and allow to rest at room temperature for 15-30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place a large nonstick skillet or pan over medium low heat. Lightly grease with oil or butter.</li>
        <li>Once thoroughly heated, add 1/4 – 1/3 cup (60-80 milliliters) batter to the center and immediately tilt the pan in a circle to coat the bottom in a thin layer.</li>
        <li>Cook until set on the top and the bottom turns golden, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Flip and cook until the other side is golden, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Remove to plate. Rub the pan with more oil and repeat with remaining batter.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately with sour cream, jam, honey, and/or sweetened condensed milk.</li>
    </ol>
