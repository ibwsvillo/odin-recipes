    <h3>Blinchiki are small, thin Russian pancakes often filled with savory or sweet fillings and then cooked or baked. They are a variation of blini or crepes, and the name "blinchiki" is a diminutive form, often used when referring to the filled versions. </h3>
    <p>In the West, blini traditionally refers to small savory pancakes made with leavened batter. In modern Russian, the term most often refers to pan-sized leavened thin pancakes, although smaller leavened pancakes are also called blini. Smaller and thicker pancakes (with several of them baked on one larger pan) are called oladyi.</p>
    <p>Blintzes, called blinchiki (little blinis) in Russian are an offshoot of blini or crêpes. They are basically rolls based on thin pancakes usually made of wheat flour, folded to form a casing for various kinds of filing, typically cheese, fruit, or (in Russian cuisine) pre-fried minced meat, and then sautéed or baked</p>
