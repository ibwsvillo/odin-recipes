    <h3>These versatile pan-fried patties are made from a mixture of ground meat, eggs, and finely mashed (or riced) boiled potatoes.</h3>
    <p>Within the Persian culinary landscape, there is a family of pan-fried patties (meat-based as well as vegetarian),  some of which have been around for a long time. Kotlets are relative newcomers to this family, as potatoes were not introduced to Iran until sometime between the late 18th and early 19th centuries.</p>
    <p>In fact, the Persian word "kotlet" is a loanword based on the French word "c√¥telette," which had found its way into the Persian language shortly after European travelers began to explore Iran extensively in the early 19th century.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>2 russet potato</li>
        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>3 tbsp. flour</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp turmeric</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>4 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Grate the onion. Squeeze it very hard and dispose all the juice. (The juice will make the patties fall apart). Peel and grate the potato as well.</li>
        <li>Mix the grated onion with ground beef.</li>
        <li>Add the egg, flour and spices, using your hand, mix everything until well combined. The mixture is going to be very sticky.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a shallow pan over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Place a bowl of water near yourself, wet your hands, take about 2 tablespoons of the patty mixture, form into oval and fry it in the oil, about 5 minutes on each side until brown and cooked inside.</li>
        <li>Serve warm with tomatoes, fries and pickled cucumber.</li>
    </ol>
